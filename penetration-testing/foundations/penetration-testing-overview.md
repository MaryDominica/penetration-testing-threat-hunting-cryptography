# Penetration Testing Overview

## Definition
Penetration testing is an authorised and controlled security assessment
that simulates a cyber attack and finds weaknesses in the computer systems security

## Purpose of Penetration Testing
- Identify security weaknesses
- Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls
- Reduce organisational risk
- Improve overall security posture

## Importance of Penetration Testing
Penetration testing helps organisations:
- offer a more comprehensive solution to cybersecurity than vulnerability assessments alone
- gives ethical hackers an in-depth knowledge of how real attackers might use these vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt operations
- Detect vulnerabilities early
- Prevent data breaches
- Protect sensitive information
- Meet regulatory and compliance requirements

## Regulatory and Compliance Context
Penetration testing supports compliance with security standards and regulations
like 
- Data Security regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR which require specific security controls,
- PCI-DSS which applies to organisations processing credit card transactions and requires regular external and internal penetration testing and
- support compliance with voluntary information security standards like ISO/IEC 27001 by demonstrating due diligence in identifying and mitigating risks.

## Types of Penetration Testing
- Application penetration testing
- Network penetration testing
- Hardware penetration testing
- Personnel penetration testing

## Key Takeaway
Penetration testing is not about breaking systems but about strengthening them
through ethical and structured security assessment.
