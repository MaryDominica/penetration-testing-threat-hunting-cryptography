# Planning Phase of Penetration Testing

## Overview
The planning phase specifies which systems will be examined, the testing schedule and methodologies employed.
It ensures the assessment is authorised, ethical, and aligned with
organisational objectives. Also establishes the extent of information that pentesters will have beforehand.

## Purpose of the Planning Phase
- Define objectives
- Establish boundaries
- Minimise operational risks
- Ensure legal authorisation

## Core Components
The planning phase is primarily defined by:
- Penetration testing scope
- Rules of engagement

These components guide all activities in later phases.

## Key Takeaway
A successful penetration test depends heavily on thorough planning.
Without clear planning, testing can become ineffective or unethical.
