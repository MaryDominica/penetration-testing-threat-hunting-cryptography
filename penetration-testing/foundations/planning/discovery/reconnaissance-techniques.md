# Reconnaissance Techniques

## Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance involves collecting information without directly
interacting with target systems.

### Examples
- Visiting and analysing public websites
- Social media
- Using tools such as Whois
- Search engine results
- Accessing public records
- Job listings

## Active Reconnaissance
Active reconnaissance involves direct interaction with systems in a
controlled and authorised manner.

### Examples
- Network scanning
- Banner grabbing
- Packet sniffing tools
- Vulnerability scanners
- DNS enumeration
- Social engineering techniques
- Dumpster diving

## Comparison
Passive reconnaissance is low-risk and stealthy, while active reconnaissance
provides deeper insights but requires strict authorisation.

## Key Takeaway
Both passive and active reconnaissance are essential and must be used
responsibly within defined boundaries.
