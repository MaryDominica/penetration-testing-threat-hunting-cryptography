Ethical cybersecurity learning repository focused on penetration testing, threat sensing, and cryptography fundamentals
# Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, and Cryptography – Learning Repository

# Overview
This repository documents my learning journey through a cybersecurity course covering
penetration testing, threat sensing and hunting, and cryptography.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Reinforce my understanding through structured notes
- Demonstrate ethical and defensive security knowledge
- Track my progress as I develop core cybersecurity skills

All content is based on authorised, ethical, and educational learning contexts.


# Module 1: Penetration Testing Foundations

# Key Topics Covered
- Meaning of penetration testing
- Difference between ethical hacking and penetration testing
- Importance of penetration testing in modern organisations
- Regulatory compliance and risk management through penetration testing
- Types of penetration testing
- Common penetration testing myths 


## Penetration Testing Process

## Phases of Penetration Testing
1. Planning
2. Discovery (Reconnaissance)
3. Attack
4. Verification
5. Reporting


# Planning Phase
The planning phase defines how the penetration test will be conducted and includes:
- Penetration testing scope  
  - Five core elements that define what systems, assets, and techniques are permitted
- Rules of engagement  
  - Eight key concepts that establish legal, ethical, and operational boundaries

Together, the scope and rules of engagement ensure penetration testing is controlled,
authorised, and aligned with organisational objectives.


Discovery Phase (Reconnaissance)
The discovery phase focuses on information gathering and includes:
- Passive reconnaissance
  - Collecting publicly available information without directly interacting with target systems
- Active reconnaissance
  - Direct interaction with systems in a controlled and authorised environment

This module also covered:
- Ethical use of Google Dorking in penetration testing
- Purpose of Google Dorking for identifying exposed information
- Use of search operators, wildcards, and special characters
- Combining Google Dork commands responsibly for security assessment


Ethical Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only.
All techniques discussed are intended for use in authorised, legal, and ethical security testing environments.

No real-world systems are targeted, and no malicious activity is supported or encouraged.


## Next Steps
- Penetration Testing - Attack Phase
- Penetration Testing - Reporting Phase
- Threat sensing and threat hunting concepts
- Detection strategies and indicators of compromise
